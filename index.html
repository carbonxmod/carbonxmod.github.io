                <h3>overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Isomorphic keyboards are musical instruments with unique key
                    layouts. Through their thoughtful design any given sequence
                    and combination of musical intervals, in essence scales and
                    chords translate to the same shape on the keyboard,
                    regardless of their root note. This property provides a more
                    intuitive mental model for understanding and learning the
                    intricacies of music theory. Exercising scales and chords in
                    different roots becomes obsolete, since transposing does not
                    involve learning new movements. Isomorphic keyboards ditch
                    the legacy created by decisions taken across many centuries
                    and present to us a clean slate: a medium where exploring
                    new ideas is not constrained by history.

                <h3>design</h3>
                <p>
                    Retrofitting a traditional keyboard with an isomorphic
                    layout constraints the options of alternative designs we can
                    choose from. The least intrusive adaptation I could come up
                    with only involved swapping out the keys to custom ones. The
                    design borrows its layout from the Jank√≥ keyboard, but
                    reduces the number of rows to four, accommodating the
                    limited vertical space available on the original instrument.
                    Horizontal distance between keys remains the same as on a
                    traditional keyboard, facilitating skill transfer. The
                    motivation for hexagonal shapes as buttons is mostly
                    aesthetic, but by having larger area than circles, they are
                    also easier to hit. The components were designed entirely in
                    Fusion 360.

                <h3>manufacturing</h3>
                <p>
                    The components were 3D printed on a Prusa i3 MK3 printer
                    without any support material. The <i>braces</i> were printed
                    upside down with <i>PETG</i>, the material's flexibility
                    helps the keys to settle more easily in their places and its
                    smoothness reduces friction when the keys are pressed. The
                    <i>keys</i> were printed on their sides with <i>PLA</i>, the
                    material's sturdiness keeps the components from blending
                    when force is applied. I would highly recommend adhering to
                    the previous instruction, using PETG renders the keys too
                    flimsy to use. The <i>buttons</i> were printed upright with
                    <i>PETG</i>. Since this material is silkier, it is more
                    pleasant to touch. This is the most exposed part of the
                    design, PETG also tends to resist ultraviolet light better.
                    Like the buttons, the <i>sliders</i> were also printed
                    upright with <i>PETG</i> for similar reasons.
                    <br />
                    For one octave you will need 1 <i>brace</i>, 6
                    <i>long keys</i>, 6 <i>short keys</i>, 14
                    <i>white buttons</i>, 10 <i>black buttons</i>.

                <h3>assembly</h3>
                <p>
                    The modification was designed for the M-Audio Oxygen MK III
                    MIDI controller with any number of keys. In order to install
                    the new keys, the old ones have to be removed entirely.
                    Replacing the keys is possible after disassembling the
                    keyboard by loosening the screws on its bottom. The old keys
                    consist of three injection molded parts per octave, they can
                    be removed by loosening the screws. The components have to
                    be assembled into sections spanning one octave. The keys
                    should be inserted into their slots in the brace and held in
                    place by a steel wire with a diameter of 1.1mm. The buttons
                    should snap on the keys when pressed. When placing the
                    assembled parts in their places the hooks on the bottom of
                    the keys should be under the dampener strip on the keyboard.
                    Fasten the sections with screws, but use smaller ones or
                    print additional spacers on top of all the screw holes on
                    the braces. Otherwise the screws will poke holes on the
                    bottom of the keyboard, since the original keys had a higher
                    base then the brace. Screw the bottom of the keyboard back.

                <h3>play</h3>
                <p>
                    Engineering my way out of tedious piano practice did not
                    play out as I planned: learning the new layout is serious
                    effort. While dexterity acquired during piano practice
                    certainly helps a lot, old muscle memories unfortunately do
                    not translate as well. I have always played piano just for
                    fun without any serious intent, so I do not feel the urge of
                    going back to the original layout. I prefer exploring the
                    unfolding patterns on the new layout more than gaining some
                    comfort in my fading piano playing ability. All this being
                    said, if you decide to build this device and you will threat
                    it as a new, unknown instrument, you will probably have some
                    joyful moments playing it.
